- Who operates the NASrecoveryBoston service?
  - Our founder is long time Boston resident Stephen Haran. Click here for his LinkedIn page. He holds a Computer Science degree from Boston College and worked professionally as a Computer Systems Manager for 25 years. Stephen is an innovator in the field of automated and remote data recovery.
- Other providers charge significantly more. How can you charge significantly less?
  - In our opinion it is hard to justify the exorbitant pricing our competitors charge. Now it is true some cases are very complex but most are fairly easy for an experienced hand to resolve quickly. In short, very low overhead, vast experience, and innovative recovery techniques make our low fees possible.
- How do I know my data is safe?
  - Data security is our top concern. For maximum security choose our on-site recovery option where we visit you at your home or office and perform the recovery work under your supervision.
- Where are you located?
  - We operate from a small office located behind the CVS Pharmacy at 703 Gallivan Blvd., very close to I-93 South Exit 12, Neponset / Quincy and I-93 North Exit 11, Granite Ave / Ashmont. Note we are open by appointment only, so call ahead.
